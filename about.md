I am an Aston University graduate who is hoping joining consulting down the line.

I am from [Delhi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi), India. I completed my O-Levels and A-Levels from 
[Colombo International School](http://www.cis.lk/) in Sri Lanka. I then joined 
[Aston University](http://www.aston.ac.uk/), United Kingdom and completed my BEng in 
[Electrical & Electronics Engineering](http://www.aston.ac.uk/eas/about-eas/academic-groups/electronic-engineering/) 
there.

I'm always up for a challenge, and enjoy experiencing new situations. I love electronics designing, 
reading novels and interacting with people when it comes to work. I play football as a right winger 
and cricket, coming in at 4th. Having grown up during the tech-bubble I enjoy playing PC games and 
fully embrace the social networking tools, console gaming, using the latest products released by tech 
giants. I enjoy travelling to new places, having grown up in 8 different countries; as a result I adapt 
extremely well to different cultures and routines. To know more about me and stuff I do you can check out 
my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SharmaTushant), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/tushant.sharma.33), 
or just surf this website.

My academic interets are mainly Electrical Circuit Design, Electronic Programming and Systems Design. 
I did work placements at 
[Tata Consultancy Services](http://www.tataafrica.com/businesses/businesses_IScommunication_tcs.htm) in 
South Africa, working in a Project Management role with client [Neotel](http://www.neotel.co.za/). 
I also worked at [PJM Interconnection](http://www.pjm.com/) in an Operations Development role where I 
concentrated on testing, maintanence and delivery of internal softwares such as 
[eDART](http://www.pjm.com/markets-and-operations/etools/edart.aspx) for clients.
