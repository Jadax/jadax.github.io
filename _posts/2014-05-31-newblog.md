Today I decided to migrate my blogging from eBlogger to Github. Been looking at doing this for a while and 
finally decided to move ahead with the plans after reading up on Jekyll and general programming formats that I
needed to learn (trust me, it's quite a lot!) What tipped my mind to finally do it was the fact that I was paying
close to $50 for hosting that I didn't use to it's full potential.

Some of the big things people consider when switching to a new 'host' is ability to import posts and allowing
comments - both I honestly didn't care very much for due to the fact that the main aim of this blog/website is to
have a 'running commentary' of what I do during university, post-graduation and what my aims for the future are.
Comments would be useful, but it wasn't high up on my priority list, nor were older posts from eBlogger - most of 
those were me just raginging at how tough my Signal Processing module at university was, or the fact that my final
project turned out to be a lot grander in scale than I had originally planned.

All this chitter chatter aside, I have finally decided to go ahead and start using Jekyll blogging + Github hosting
to make my life that much easier and get basic programming knowledge (and it's quite easy too once you get the hang
of it). Hopefully these static webpages will work for what I have in mind because down the line if I ever have to 
use dynamic content that can't be hosted on Github then I'm not sure the switch from Github to whatever will be as
smooth.
