Today I decided to migrate my blogging from eBlogger to Github. 
Been looking at doing this for a while and finally decided to 
move ahead with the plans after reading up on Jekyll and 
general programming formats that I needed to learn 
(trust me, it's quite a lot!) What tipped my mind to finally 
do it was the fact that I was paying close to $50 for hosting 
that I didn't use to its full potential.

Some of the big things people consider when switching to a new 
'host' is ability to import posts and allowing comments - both 
I honestly didn't care very much for because the 
main aim of this blog is to have a 'running commentary' 
of what I do during university, post-graduation and what my aims 
for the future are. Comments would be useful, but it wasn't high 
up on my priority list, nor were older posts from eBlogger - most of 
those were me just raging at how tough my Signal Processing 
module at university was, or the fact that my final project turned 
out to be a lot bigger in scale than I had originally planned.

All this chit-chat aside, I have finally decided to go ahead 
and start using Jekyll blogging + Github hosting to make my life that 
much easier and get basic programming knowledge (and it's quite easy 
too once you get the hang of it). Hopefully these static web-pages will 
work for what I have in mind because down the line if I ever have to 
use dynamic content that can't be hosted on Github then I'm not sure 
the switch from Github to whatever will be as smooth.
