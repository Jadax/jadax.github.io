title: "Why Volunteer?"

In the last few months I've been wondering why I actually 
decided to volunteer at Asha. I didn't get paid, I didn't get 
any letters of recommendation, I didn't get my name on a plaque 
or on a website. The children we helped have probably already 
forgotten me, so why did I spend the last 3-4 months doing 
this.

The answer isn't as simple as one would think.

I didn't do this to impress future adcoms, or employers or 
try to rub it in my friends faces. I definitely didn't do 
it for the non-existant prestige there is for this sort 
of thing in India (none by the way, in case you are wondering). 
I spoke to a friend a couple of days ago who asked me 
what I'd been up to. I wasn't sure how to answer that. I mean 
I'm doing something important, something I did to a certain 
degree back in England when I was studying there, so why was 
I not sure how to tell my friend this? 

The issue is that in India, voluntary work is not something 
held in positive regard - people are starting to get very 
'donation-happy', but in general, unpaid work is still 
considered unpaid, and everything here is marked to how much 
you are earning (your earning potential). So once again, I asked 
myself what was the point of Asha?

Ultimately, I think it's just a personal choice. I needed 
something to fill my time here, and since I had enjoyed working 
at the [Ramgarhia Sikh Temple](http://www.rstuk.com/) in England 
so much, I decided it was worth the time investment for me. The 
satisfaction I get from being a part of the community when we 
take part in the projects is something I'll leave for the interviews, 
but the definite feeling here is that it's not necessary, but 
recommended wholeheartedly.

Go out and contribute to society! There are many children in 
this world who need your help.
