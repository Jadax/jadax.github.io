title: "Why Volunteer?"

In the last few weeks I've been wondering why I volunteered
at Asha for Education and didn't do a full-time job. The 
norm in India is to work straight after graduation, so why 
did I decide to go for unpaid voluntary work instead? Am I 
trying to spruce up my CV for the future? Am I just wasting 
my time? Don't I know what I want to do?

The reason isn't so simple to describe. The main reason I decided to 
volunteer was because I didn't get the job I wanted. In England, 
I reached the final stages of several application processes, 
but for one reason or another I wasn't able to get the jobs and this 
sapped my energy significantly. By January I decided enough 
was enough and came back to India to try my luck here. 

My priority was MBA so I applied for that, whilst also trying 
to get jobs I wanted to do. Things were starting to look up. 
I got admitted into a good university in India for MBA (not 
world-renowned, but an extremely strong national reputation), 
and since I wasn't getting positive job replies I decided to 
do volunteer work until my MBA course started. I had enjoyed 
volunteering at the Ramgarhia Gurdwara in Birmingham and was
hoping India would provide me with the same mental satisfaction. 

As things turned out, I ended up not being able to attend the MBA 
course due to red-tape in getting my UK degree converted into an 
Indian degree. My job process wasn't looking too good either 
as most students in India get a job via campus recruiting (which 
I didn't have access to being an International graduate).

So I guess there you have it, I volunteered because it kind of just fell 
into place. I know for sure I would have left Asha once my MBA course 
started, or if I had gotten a job (as the Asha work was at least 
14-15 hrs away from where I live), but did I do it because I 
was bored? Absolutely not. I did it because I wanted to, and 
because I could.

Though now I'm thinking - was it worth it? Will my friends and 
future employers see what I did was important to me, or will they 
see it as a waste of time? I guess only time will tell.
